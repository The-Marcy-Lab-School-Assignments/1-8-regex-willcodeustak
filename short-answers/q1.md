# Question

`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get _all_ instances of a pattern?

# Answer

'g' Global should be the regex that allows all instances of a pattern. Meaning it matches all occurrences not just the first one.
